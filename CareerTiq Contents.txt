Ep 4:

Cryptography Basics:
secure communication
plain text - cipher text
authorized user, keys

Key management:
generate, store, distribute, revoke
Types:
symmetric = [AES, DES].
asymmetric = [RSA, ECC].

Hash functions = data into fixed size hash values
data integrity, verification, digital signatures
collision resistance, preimage resistance.

Should not hinder availability. resist DOS.
Non-repudiation- sender cannot deny message origin.
Digital signature provide non-repudiation by associating sender's ID with message.

Concepts:
Digital signatures.[authentication]. (asymmetric key use in opposite way...)
Hash functions.[data integrity].
secure key exchange protocols.
SSL/TLS, SSH = cryptographic protocols.
Cryptanalysis. break cryptographic systems.

Cryptography Ensures:
Confidentiality   (encryption)
Integrity   (hash functions, digital signatures)
Authentication   (HMAC) - verify user. hash based message authentication code
Nonrepudiation
Key management

Symmetric
Asymmetric
Hash functions

secure key management

-------------------------------------------

Internet = forest
anyone can listen

VPN = encrypt, tunnel.
Proxy = intermediate.

Tor uses proxy(6)- 3 open, 3 anonymous.
Anonymity. not safety.
No log policy.

Tails, Qubes... = safe OS.

Visit darkweb for scientific purposes...
gore, warcrimes, drugs, humans, trade...

SYN = hi
SYN, ACK = roger, hi
ACK = roger
client starts it. The " Threeway Handshake ". exclusively TCP.

TCP 3 way handshake
TLS handshake

Different packet types. FIN...

UDP = no retransmission.
QUIC = new L4 protocol. uses sockets.

HTTP methods and response codes:
  1.. = informational message
  2.. = success
  3.. = redirection
  4.. = client error
  5.. = server error

first page = index.html

elements of security: CIA++

Tamper proof data

difference, realtime use of sym & asym cryptography.

Bank statements = Symmetric.
HTTPS = Asymmetric.

Symmetric = 1 key
Asymmetric = 2 keys. TLS handshake does it.
no lock symbol = http = no TLS handshake. No Asymmetric encryption.

Public key exchange between client and server
PKI = public key infrastructure
Keys are there!! = in browser.

cloud widely used nowadays. secure remote connection.
ssh widely used = shell = no GUI and only CLI.

to check public, private key:
  pwd
  ls
  ls -a = see hidden files
  --- ssh-keygen
  cd .ssh
  cat id_rsa

windows = ssh = access linux machine.
windows = ssh client = pre installed.

connect realPC and fakeVM with ssh connection
fakeVM = server. realPC = client.

--- sudo su = super user
--- systemctl start ssh
--- systemctl start apache2 = start own server

ifconfig = note the fakeVM ip address
paste it in realPC browser

splunk forwarder in optional files

do the ground work on company

delete /opt = kali still works
delete /bin = can't use terminal

binary file is an executable file
.sh in Linux
.exe in windows
.py also

change repo from http to https
sources.list file

know the attacks
know the tools
know the steps
know how to secure

[ website.informer.com ] = footprinting

website details

website grading, coding error

[ sitechecker.pro ]= audit tool
coding errors there?

code
network
Linux

no sir

find public ip = what is my ip
find private ip = ping in cmd

public ip = track you

--------------------------------
gather info from email?
from ip ok
but email?

footprinting process bro

show original
get ip
track ip -> 

footpriting
scanning

need data analytics dashboard

private eye
people search

see open ports without nmap in our system?
control panel -> system & security -> firewall ->
advanced setting -> inbound, outbound rule -> see
ports.

ip scanner tool to track the ip
advance port scanner to scan for ports
angry ip scanner = scan a network

tools zone in every module is better

nmap wont be used by all bro
need alternatives for all

first do network scanning, find hosts
then go port scanning

accunetix tool

REPORT

banner grabbing
getting server details

DO PRACTICALLY BROO

nslookup
akamaiedge.net

id serve
-> gives banner grabbing info of website
the server details

super scan -> enumeration tool
netstat -a
net use
enumeration = enter PC, see the drive

trail version of acunetix

many tools for sae process there
find the easier one

VAPT

CCST = base
go fast
CEH = home
target = experience

research
- shadon.io
gathering info

--------------------------------------

its simple

learn about the 2 parties
learn the attacks
learn the defence
KEEP GOING

5/6/24:

access control = authorization
so, ACL = authorization list?
http status codes

index page loaded as default

var/www/html
default path of web server
etc/passwd
etc/shadow

owner-group-others
rwx-rwx-rwx

directory traversal

where to look for etc/passwd directory?

/var/www/html/images/218.png

/etc/passwd = 404 error
../../../etc/passwd = 404 again?
../../../../etc/passwd …
automate this
= directory traversal payload:
payloadallthethings github repo
also seclists

add these repo in your GitHub
share in resume

copy payload -> paste -> check
keep checking until you get 200 code
directory_traversal.txt

try:
deep_traversal.txt
840 lines here. there 140 lines.
damn
write a python code to automate
simple for loop
use burp suite to automate things

python request response module?
OOP not needed but functions, file handling, requests...

advent of cyber 2023?

burp suite

vulnerability analysis = zaproxy
pentesting = burpsuite

= sign in url
do dir traversal there

filename=
…
find a point where they are loading a file from somewhere

user_id = 1
means do sql, NoSQL injection

how data is being transported
NoSQL
like in dictionary
data sent in JSON or XML

when data gets loaded from directory
try directory traversal

open image in new tab
do dir traversal

used image tag
but trying to load a text file
rendered image

page source of image

view page source is disabled

in url do
view-source tag

valid users with a shell
grep bin/bash

burpsuite = intermediate between client and server

initiate final year project work

burp suite = a proxy

view-source before https

revshells.com

investigate in forensics
find unwanted ones
close the process

BPS tabs:
error displayed in dashboard
target tab = all website we load
(sitemap = total directories

burpsuite port number 8080
don't run any other erver in 8080
leave for burpsuite

proxy -> settings -> local host/ loopback address

change if you want
chromium
burpsuite has a browser within
to make it legal

if browser don't open
use foxyproxy extension
allows to switch proxy

download certificate...?

-------------------------------------------------------
6/6/24:

robots.txt
to control bots

install certificates
burp suite
see what is happening in backend

ctrl + f to keyword search
view-source

solve with cookies - browser
solve with burpsuite

lab link
cop and paste in burp suite browserproxy -> open browser
check http history -> all things here
sort in time
see status code
GET my-account -> 320 to login
GET login -> 200


in response,
render la ye browser see

clear objective

/admin after the domain

remove from scope = unwanted pages
to remove unwanted requests
