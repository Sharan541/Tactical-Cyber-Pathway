==================================
computer?:

laptop
desktop
smart phones
smart watches

----------------------------------

electronic device that manipulates info/data

sees data as binary
but it knows how to combine them into
much more complex things
such as a photo, website, games etc

----------------------------------

computers use a combo of
- hardware
- software

hardware: physical part of computer
internal and external components
like monitor, keyboard

software: set of instructions that
tells hardware what to do
like web browser, media player etc

==================================
computer types:

people -> computer -> mostly personal computer

common ones uses Windows OS, Chrome OS, Mac OS
iOS, Android OS in mobile phones

computers comes in many different shapes and sizes

appliances with built in computers
limited capabilities

other type = server
sends info to other computers on network

web servers -> internet service

servers in offices

many types out there

==================================
buttons and ports on a computer:

some universal buttons
power buttons placements...

power chord -> power socket
laptop? -> charging port

USB ports -> plug in any device needed
keyboard, printers, USB drives

some -> USB C ports

some laptop -> C port charging

desktop -> monitor port -> connect monitor

monitor connection types:
- HDMI
- VGA
- mini DisplayPort
- USB-C

laptop -> display port -> monitor

ethernet port -> connect to internet
if no wi-fi

ethernet cable -> modem/router

audio jack? -> wired headphone/speaker

disk drive (may have)
insert CD/DVD/blue-ray disc

some big port -> older peripherals like mice, keyboards,
printers
newer versions connect via USB/wirelessly

every computer is different
tech is always changing
take a closer look at your computer
to find what options you have

==================================
basic parts of a computer:

many computer types
similar parts to operate

parts, uses

reference with standard desktop model

----------------------------------

computer case -> holds main components
where the actual processing happen

tower cases (vertical)
can come in other shapes, sizes too

to view things -> need monitor
uses video processor in computer case
to display contents

LCD/LED display
thin

all in one models = more compact
combines monitor, computer case into
a single unit

interact? -> need keyboard/mouse/touchscreen

wireless, ergonomic keyboards

mouse -> optical sensor -> detect movements

laptops:
built in screen
computer case
keyboard
touchpad

small touch sensitive area
control mouse pointer

portability

built in battery

can connect external monitor, mouse, keyboard
if wanted

laptop -> made into a desktop

each part -> different role

==================================
inside a computer:

there are many important parts inside a computer
what exactly do they do?

components

computer -> large circuit board -> mother board

motherboard:
- CPU -> processor (brain)
tends to get hot
covered by a heatsink
draws heat away from processor
- RAM -> short term memory
uses when performing calculations
can't store files
cleared when shut down

hard drive:
provides long tern storage
(storage, not memory)
keeps all computer data
many use a magnetic platter
new ones have solid state drives
faster, durable, expensive

desktop computer -> motherboard -> expansion slots
upgrade by adding expansion cards
add video card -> better graphics performance
add wireless card -> connect to wireless home network

most laptops -> no expansion slots

computer's components need electricity to run

power supply unit
designed to take power from wall outlet and
send it to all components that need power

laptops -> built in battery

so:
motherboard
hard drive/SSD
power supply unit/battery
extra fan, heatsink

==================================
getting to know laptop computers:

portable unlike desktop

no need to setup
just start
smaller though

battery
recharge

power cut time also works

built in touchpad/trackpad

desktop?
can buy any monitor, mouse, keyboard
laptop?
no such freedom
as it's all built in

can use laptop's ports to connect to a
separate monitor, keyboard, mouse

turning a laptop to a desktop
best of both worlds

disconnect when wanted and move

as per needs

==================================
OS:

us, computer speak different languages

it speaks in 1s, 0s
can't communicate directly with computer
that's why we have OS

OS = program that lets us interact with computer

OS, computer hardware = complete system
that determines what our computer can do

many different OS
2 most common = windows, mac OS

windows OS comes pre-loaded on most
personal computers

OS as per device
iOS, android OS...
mobile, tablet, smart watch etc

before downloading a new program/application,
know if it is available for that OS or not

some work on all devices
others on certain ones

==================================
applications:

alarm app
YouTube app
games

app = software program
that lets us DO things

complete tasks
for fun
