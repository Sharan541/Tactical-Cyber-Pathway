search for D MAC -> find port -> send
---------------
how switch builds MAC address table?
H1 -> ethernet frame -> H4
---------------
switch -> receive E frame:
-----
1- do I have S MAC on table?
add to correct port(FA 0/1)
-----
2- is D MAC on table?
don't know where?
-----
3- act like a hub. send to all port
except incoming port (broadcast)
not match?, ignore rest of frame
-----
4- match -> receive frame.
if there in table already,
just send it there. (unicast)
-----
5- this info stays for [5 minutes]

~ [12223]
---------------

-------------------------
BROADCAST:
---------------
broadcast transmission (one - all)
~ [D IP = 255.255.255.255]

[IPv6 don't]
---------------
sent to all in that broadcast domain
-----
> directed broadcast -> all hosts on specific network
host on 172.16.4.0/24 -> 172.16.4.255
-----
> limited broadcast -> 255.255.255.255

=========================
NETWORK SEGMENTATION:

-------------------------
NETWORK SEGMENTATION:
---------------
ethernet LAN -> ethernet broadcast
-----
[ARP] request for target's MAC address
[layer 2 broadcast domain]
router doesn't forward ethernet broadcast.
---------------
DHCP discover message
for DHCP server.
gives IP etc to client
router segments
L2 broadcast domains.
---------------

-------------------------
BROADCAST DOMAIN, SEGMENTATION:
---------------
broadcast email in school
sometimes for a segment alone
-----
ethernet LAN =
broadcasts, ARP to locate other devices.
ARP -> L2 broadcast for MAC
-----
switch forwards to other switch
but router doesn't
---------------

-------------------------
LARGE BROADCAST DOMAIN PROBLEMS:
---------------
~ -=-
large broadcast domain
excess broadcast
affects network with traffic
-----
reduce size:
create smaller broadcast domains
~ subnetting
smaller network spaces = subnet.
---------------
~ -=-
subnetting vs segmentation:
> [segment] for security [L2]:
may involve L3, VLAN or physical, reduce collision domains
> [subnet] to manage [L3]:
reduce broadcast traffic, better IP util
---------------
consider a network:
172.16.0.0/16
2 octets for hosts
-----
make it 0 and 1
can make more than 2
but for current need
it's not necessary
-----
172.16.0.0/24 + 172.16.1.0/24
400 users -> 200 + 200 users
a router in the middle.
-----
steal host bits ->
create additional subnets.
---------------

-------------------------
REASONS TO SEGMENT NETWORKS:
---------------
- reduce traffic
- improve performance
- reduce misconfigurations effects
- security policies
-----
subnet based on:
- location
- group/function
- device type

continue operation
even if a component fail
multiple paths = redundancy
quick recovery
-----
- " packet-switched network "
splits traffic into packets
'route over shared network'
packets -> different path to same destination

expand quickly
support new ones
without degrading performance
add easily to existing ones
no need to design again

M5 = NETWORK LAYER:

=========================
INTRODUCTION:

-----
network layer
L3 in OSI
gives services to devices to
exchange data across networks

DATA ENCAPSULATION:
-----
-=-
L7   -  HTTPS header + data
L4   -  TCP header + data
L3   -  IPv4 header + data
L2   -  Ethernet header + data + trailer
L1   -  frame encoded as bits
-----
[ protocol + data ]
of a layer becomes data portion
of next protocol.
-----

---------------
NETWORK LAYER:
-----
exchange data across networks
IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, OSPF
at L3
-----
-=- ~ OSPF at L3?
-----
L4 'manage' data export between

-----

---------------
IP ENCAPSULATION:
-----
IP -> encapsulate transport layer segment
with IP header
IP header used to deliver packet
to D host.
-----
[IP header | Data(segment header | data)]
in () = transport layer PDU
network layer PDU -> IP packet
-----
-=- ~
[encapsulate data layer by layer]

---------------
CHARACTERISTICS OF IP:
-----
-=- ~
IP = protocol with [low overhead]
necessary functions to deliver
[can't track], manage flow of packets
done by TCP at L4
-----
[connectionless]
no established connection before sending packets
-----
[best effort]
IP is unreliable. no guarantee
-----
[media independent]
copper, fibre, wireless
-----

---------------
CONNECTIONLESS:
-----
-=- ~
no dedicated end to end connection created
before sending data.
letter -> mail box -> receiver
-----
no initial exchange of control information
to establish connection
-----
[ IP header | segment ]
-----

---------------
BEST EFFORT:
-----
no additional fields in header
reduces overhead
senders unaware if received
some packets maybe be lost
-----
-=- ~
ahh I see
so IP header doesn't have
any for connection but
TCP header has right. Now
you compare IP, TCP header
-----

---------------
MEDIA INDEPENDENT:
-----
> no capability for packet retransmissions
> packets are missing
> out-of-order packets
-----
[ reliability is role of TCP at L4 ]
-----
[ signals over a medium travel
over different media ]
-----
-=- ~

maximum size of PDU for medium to transport
-----
-=- L2 pass MTU value to L3

map IPv4 to MAC
-----
IP - ARP - MAC
-----
send packet to a host on same LAN
need IPv4, MAC address of D host.
D IP known or resolved by device name
but MAC should be discovered.
use ARP, determine D MAC:
-----
functions:
> resolve IPv4 to MAC
> maintain table of IPv4 to MAC
-----
-=- ~ resolve & maintain table
-----

---------------
ARP FUNCTIONS:
-----
packet sent to L2 -> encapsulate with frame
refer 'table in memory', find MAC mapped to IPv4
stored temporarily in RAM
ARP table or ARP cache.
-----
D on same network = it's MAC
D on remote network = DG's MAC
-----
need corresponding MAC for an IP in both cases
-----
'no entry in cache -> send ARP request'
right one replies with their MAC
-----

---------------
ARP OPS - ARP REQUEST:
-----
-=- ~
ARP messages have
type field of " 0x806 ".
-----
ARP requests are broadcasts
-----
D MAC not on ARP table of host?
hold the packet
send ARP request
ARP reply with D MAC
send
-----

---------------
ARP OPS - ARP RESPONSE:
-----
only associated devices respond
encapsulated in an Ethernet frame
> DMAC
> SMAC
> type = type field of " 0x806 "
tells receiving NIC that
data portion of the frame needs
to be passed to ARP process.
-----
no ARP reply -> packet dropped.
-----
static map entries in ARP table
rare. do not expire over time.
-----
IPv6 -> ICMPv6 ND
neighbour solicitation, advertisement messages
similar to IPv4 ARP requests and ARP replies.
-----

---------------
ARP ROLE IN REMOTE COMM:
-----
D IP not on same network
D MAC -> DG MAC.
see table or ARP request for it.
-----
every hop requires a MAC address
-----

---------------
REMOVE ENTRIES FROM ARP TABLE:
-----
ARP cache timer
remove ARP entries
unused for a while
timing differ for OS
W OS -> 15-45 seconds
-----
-=- ~ commands to manually remove
then it sends ARP request again
> CIOS:
-=- show ip arp
> MW PC:
-=- arp -a
-----

---------------
ARP ISSUES:
-----
broadcasts
~ spoofing
-----
more hosts in network
broadcast slows network
flooding local media
-----
~ ARP poisoning attack
reply to an ARP request
attacker -> ARP reply with own MAC
send packets to threat actor
-----
-=- ~
mitigate with:
dynamic ARP inspection - [ DAI ]
in enterprise level switches.

simple, common WAN topology
permanent link
between 2 end points
-----
-=- hub and spoke:
[WAN version of star topology]
central site interconnect branch sites

POINT TO POINT WAN TECHNOLOGY:
-----
-=-
physical PTP topology:
directly connect 2 nodes.
not always share same media.
limited to 2 nodes.
-----
serial comm protocol
P2P: no need to determine if incoming
[frame destined to it or another node]

=========================
MAC METHODS:

---------------
HALF, FULL DUPLEX COMM:
-----
duplex communication
direction of data transmission
-----
2 common modes:
-----
> half-duplex:
both can share but
not simultaneously
one at a time
shared medium
-----
> full-duplex:
transmit, receive simultaneously
on shared media.
L2 assume media available for transmission
for both nodes at a time.
-----
E switch -> full-duplex by default
[can also in half-duplex]
if connected to hub like devices
-----
[duplex mismatch] creates
inefficiency, latency on link.
-----

---------------
ACCESS CONTROL METHODS:
-----
ELAN, WLAN = example of multiaccess networks
multiaccess networks =
~ [multiple host attempt to access network at a time]
-----
rules to govern
how devices share physical media:
~ contention-based access
~ controlled access
-----
contention based:
all half-duplex nodes
fight for using medium
if more than 1 transmit at a time:
CSMA/CD = legacy bus topology ethernet LANs
CSMA/CA = WLAN
-----
controlled access:
each node with own time to use medium
deterministic types of legacy networks
inefficient
wait for it's turn...
-=- legacy token ring
-=- legacy 'ARCNET'
-----
- contention = fight -> solution = CD/CA
- controlled = time table - commie
-----
ELAN today = operate on full duplex
no need an access method.
-----

---------------
CONTENTION BASED ACCESS - CSMA/CD:
-----
contention = heated disagreement
-----
~ Wireless LAN (CSMA/CA)
~ Legacy bus-topology ELAN (CSMA/CD)
~ Legacy ELAN with hub (CSMA/CD)
-----
these network operate in half duplex
needs a process to govern when 1 can send
what happens if sent at same time
-----
2 send at same time = collision occur
legacy ELAN -> both host detects collision
due to CD of CSMA/CD
NIC compares data transmitted, received
signal amplitude more than normal
both device's data corrupted.
need to be resent.
-----
WLAN, legacy ELAN -> half duplex
-----
amplitude:
measure of amount of energy
transferred by wave
-----
PC1 - hub - PC2
-----
host NIC determine if others transmitting.
no carrier signal detected on medium = send.
-----
hub = [multiport repeater]
bits received are [regenerated],
sent to all ports
wait until channel is clear
with hub, host with that D MAC [copies data],
others ignore...
-----

---------------
CONTENTION BASED ACCESS - CSMA/CA:
-----
form of CSMA used by 802.11 WLAN
carrier sense multiple access/collision avoidance
(CSMA/CA).
-----
similar to CSMA/CD to detect
use additional techniques
CMSA/CA does not detect collisions
~ hard to do in wireless...
~ but avoids by waiting before transmitting
device transmitting has
time duration for transmission
all other host knows how long
medium will be unavailable.
-----
I'm receiving this wireless frame.
-----
I see in the wireless frame
channel is going to be unavailable
for a specific amount of time
so I cannot send.
-----
sender -> 802.11 frame
receiver -> ack
sender knows it arrived
-----
hub ELAN or WLAN,
CSMA do not scale well in heavy media use
-----
ELAN switch don't use contention based system
switch, host NIC operate in full-duplex mode.
-----

---------------
TEST:
-----
contention based access = CSMA/CD, CSMA/CA = fight
controlled access = ARCNET, token ring = time table
-----
access control method that needs D send
ack so sender knows frame arrived:
[~ CSMA/CA]

ROUTING TABLE:

---------------
ROUTER PACKET FORWARDING DECISION:
-----
host routing tables...
Router routing tables.
router operations
at network layer.
-----

-----
stores 3 types of route entries:
-----
~> directly connected networks
-----

---------------
STATIC ROUTING:
-----
-=- ~
manually configured routes
includes:
[ remote network address + IP of next hop router ]
-=- ip route 10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 209.165.200.226
-----
10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0 = remote network address

dynamic routing protocol automatically does:
~> discover remote networks
~> maintain up-to-date routing info
~> choose best path to D

------
static or dynamic routing:
- remote network address,
- next hop address
entered into IP routing table.
-----
some routers use static,
dynamic routing combo...
-----

---------------
IPv4 ROUTER ROUTING TABLES:
-----
unlike host routing table,
different items included in
each entry of routing table.
-----
~ [entries in routing table]:

===============================================
M4 = IPv6 ADDRESSING:

=========================
SUMMARY:

---------------
IPv6 ADDRESS TYPES:
-----
3 types:
-> unicast
-> multicast
-> anycast
-----
does not use dotted-decimal
subnet mask notation.
prefix length represented in slash notation
indicates the network portion.
-----
-=- unicast address:
uniquely identifies an [interface]
on an IPv6-enabled device.
IPv6 -> 2 unicast addresses:
[GUA, LLA]
-----
~ IPv6 unique local addresses:
local addressing within a site or
between a limited number of sites.
devices that never need to access another network
not globally routed or
translated to global IPv6 address
-----
~ IPv6 global unicast addresses:
globally unique and routable on the IPv6 internet
equivalent to public IPv4 addresses
-----
-> GUA has 3 parts:
[ global routing prefix ]
[ subnet ID ]
[ interface ID ]
-----
IPv6 LLA:
enables a device to communicate with
other IPv6-enabled devices on [same link]
and only on that link (subnet).
get LLA statically/dynamically.
-----

---------------
GUA AND LLA STATIC CONFIGURATIONS:
-----
CIOS command to configure an IPv4 address
on an interface is:
-=- [ip address ip-address subnet-mask]
-----
command to configure IPv6 GUA on an interface is:
-=- [ipv6 address ipv6-address/prefix-length]
-----
configuring static addresses on clients
does not scale to larger environments.
enable dynamic assignment of IPv6 addresses.
-----
-=-
configuring LLA manually lets you create an
address recognizable, easier to remember.
-----
[only necessary to create LLAs on routers]
-----
LLAs can be configured manually using:
-=- ipv6 address ipv6-link-local-address link-local
[link-local]
-----
* -=- ~
-=- GUA: ipv6 address ipv6-address/prefix-length
-=- LLA: ipv6 address link-local
-=- IPv4: ip address ip-address subnet-mask
-----

---------------
DYNAMIC ADDRESSING FOR IPV6 GUAs:
-----
device get [dynamic GUA with ICMPv6] messages
IPv6 router: [periodically send ICMPv6 RA messages]
every 200 seconds
to all IPv6-enabled devices on the network
RA message also sent [in response to RS message]
[RS = request for an RA message]
-----
ICMPv6 RA message includes:
-=- network prefix
-=- prefix length
-=- default gateway address
-=- DNS addresses
-=- domain name.
-----
mask, DGA, DNS address, etc
-----
RA messages have 3 methods:
-=- SLAAC
-=- SLAAC with stateless DHCPv6 server
-=- stateful DHCPv6 (no SLAAC)
-----
SLAAC:
stateless address auto-configuration
-----
SLAAC - state
-----
-=- SLAAC:
client use info in RA message
create its own GUA because message
has prefix, interface ID.
-----
-=- SLAAC with stateless DHCPv6 server:
RA message suggest device use SLAAC
to create own IPv6 GUA, use router LLA
as default gateway address, use a stateless
DHCPv6 server to obtain other necessary info.
-----
-=- stateful DHCPv6:
RA suggests that devices use router LLA
as default gateway address,
stateful DHCPv6 server to obtain GUA,
DNS server address, domain name etc.
-----
* -=- ~
1> SLAAC - get all with 1 RA message - auto GUA
2> SLAAC + stateless DHCP recommended - auto GUA, R LLA as DGA, DHCP for others
3> SLAAC + stateful DHCP recommended - use DHCP for GUA, DNS. R LLA as DGA
-----
create [interface ID] using:
> EUI-64 process or
> randomly generated 64-bit number.
-----
EUIs process uses 48-bit Ethernet MAC address
of client and inserts another 16 bits in middle
of MAC address to create 64-bit interface ID.
-----
Depending upon OS, device may use a
randomly generated interface ID.
-----
ICMPv6 -> GUA
3 ways for ICMPv6:
[ SLAAC, SLAAC DHCP, no SLAAC ]
-----
got GUA
get LLA
-----

---------------
DYNAMIC ADDRESSING FOR IPv6 LLAs:
-----
All IPv6 devices must have an IPv6 LLA
configure manually or created dynamically
[ LLA = must ]
-----
OS like Windows will use same method for
[ SLAAC-created GUA ],
[ dynamically assigned LLA ].
-----
Cisco routers automatically create IPv6 LLA
whenever a GUA is assigned to the interface
-----
-=-
use EUI-64 to generate Interface ID for all
LLAs on IPv6 interfaces.
-----
For serial interfaces, router uses MAC address
of an Ethernet interface.
common to statically configure IPv6 LLAs on routers
easy to remember.
* -=- ~
verify IPv6 address config with 3 commands:
-=- [show ipv6 interface brief]
-=- [show ipv6 route]
-=- ping
-----
after getting GUA,
create own LLA.
-----

---------------
IPv6 MULTICAST ADDRESSES:
-----
2 types of IPv6 multicast addresses:
-=- well-known multicast addresses
-=- solicited-node multicast addresses
-----
-> assigned multicast addresses:
are reserved multicast addresses for
predefined groups of devices.
-----
well-known multicast addresses are assigned.
-----
-> common IPv6 assigned multicast groups are:
ff02::1 = all-nodes multicast group
ff02::2 = all-routers multicast group.
remember what is fe80 and ff00 ?
-----
found so far:
* -=- ~
> fe80 - linklocal
> fffe - eui64
> ff00 - multicast
> 2001 - some unicast
-----
solicited-node multicast address is similar
to all-nodes multicast address.
advantage of a solicited-node multicast address:
it is
[mapped to special Ethernet multicast address]
-----
well known = assigned = reserved
solicited-node = all-nodes
-----

M5 = IPv6 ND:

=========================
NEIGHBOUR DISCOVERY OPERATION:

---------------
IPv6 ND:
-----

[ICMPv6 - NS, NA]
like IPv4's ARP
-----
-=- ~
[ ND(NS, NA) for ARP ]
-----
RA, RS, NA, NS
for diff ops remember?
RA, RS to assign address
-----
host -> neighbour cache
[IP - MAC] mapping table.
[no entries -> ICMPv6 NS]
-----
IPv4 -> ARP request - over ethernet.
IPv6 -> ICMPv6 with IP header -> E frame header, trailer
-----
* -=- ~
> D MAC multicast
> S MAC.
> S IPv6
> D IPv6.
> target IPv6
> target MAC.
-----
ICMPv6 >> ethernet broadcast ARP request
reduce processing. efficiency
examine D MAC
router don't forward it. LLA?
-----

---------------
IPv6 ND MESSAGES:
-----
IPv6 NDP
-----
* -=- ~
ND provides:
-=- address resolution
-=- router discovery
-=- redirection services
for IPv6 using ICMPv6.
-----
[ICMPv6 ND] uses 5 ICMPv6 messages
to perform these services:
-=- NS
-=- NA
-=- RS
-=- RA
-=- [redirect message]
-----
[device to device] messaging
address resolution like ARP
[NS, NA messages]
-----
[RS, RA] for router to device
[router discovery] in
[dynamic address allocation]
and [SLAAC]
-----
NS NA = device - device
RS RA = router - device
-----
-=-
redirect message =
better next-hop selection
-----
IPv6 ND is defined in the
* -=- ~ IETF RFC 4861.
-----

---------------
IPv6 ND - ADDRESS RESOLUTION:
-----
IPv6 ND - determine MAC of a device
[NS, NA for MAC address resolution]
like  ARP Requests and ARP Replies
-----
ICMPv6 NS:
* -=- ~
[special ethernet, IPv6 multicast addresses]
less processing.
[no need to send to OS]

M6 = CISCO SWITCHES AND ROUTERS:

=========================
SUMMARY:

---------------
CISCO SWITCHES:
-----
switch:
connect devices on same network
-----
router:
connect multiple networks
-----
selecting switch for your LAN:
-=- number, type of ports
-----
Lower-cost switches may support
only copper twisted-pair interface ports.
-----
Higher priced switches may have
fibre-optic connections.
-----
~ link switch to other switches that
may be located over long distances.
-----
-=-
like switch ports,
[Ethernet NICs operate at specific bandwidths]
such as 10/100 or 10/100/1000 Mbps.
actual bandwidth of attached device will be
highest common bandwidth between device NIC, switch port.
-----
-=-
networking devices with:
fixed and modular physical configurations.
-----
-=-
[managed switch] using Cisco OS
enables control over individual ports
or over the switch as a whole.
-----
* -=- ~
Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series Ethernet switches
suitable for small and medium-sized networks.
-----

SWITCH SPEEDS, FORWARDING METHODS:
-----
too much information zone
* -=- ~
-----
switch use a
[forwarding method for switching]
-----
data between network ports:
-=- store-and-forward switching
-=- cut-through switching - [fast forward, fragment-free]
-----
2 methods of [memory buffering]:
-=- port-based memory
-=- shared memory.
-----
2 types of duplex settings used
for communications on an Ethernet network:
-=- full-duplex,
-=- half-duplex.
-----
[auto-negotiation]:
optional function
found on most Ethernet switches, NICs.
-----
enables 2 devices to auto negotiate best speed
and duplex capabilities.
Full-duplex is chosen if both devices have capability
along with their highest common bandwidth.
-----
Most switch devices now support
automatic medium-dependent interface crossover
(auto-MDIX) feature.
switch automatically detects type of cable attached
to port and configures interfaces accordingly.
-----
summary:
-----
-=- store and forward
-=- cut through -> fast forward / fragment free
-----
port based, shared memory buffering
-----
auto negotiation:
-=- bandwidth
-=- duplex
-----
auto-MDIX

---------------
SWITCH BOOT PROCESS:
-----
Cisco switches,
preconfigured to operate in LAN
as soon as they are powered on.
-----
configure basic security settings
before placing switch into network
-----
3 basic steps to "power up" a switch:
-=- check components
-=- Connect cables to switch
-=- Power up switch
-----
* -=- ~
switch ON -> POST begins:
[power-on self-test]
-----
2 methods to connect a PC to a network device
to perform configuration and monitoring tasks:
-=- out-of-band management
-=- in-band management
-----
Out-of-band management:
computer directly connected to console port
of network device that is being configured.
-----
in-band management:
monitor, configure a device
over a network connection.
-----
-=- out = physical
-=- in = wireless?
-----
Cisco device loads following 2 files
into RAM when it is booted: 
-=- [IOS image file]
-=- [start-up configuration file]
-----
IOS image file stored in flash memory
start-up config file stored in NVRAM.
-----
* -=- ~
> check components
> check cables
> ON switch
> POST
> IOS image = flash
> start-up = NVRAM.
-----

---------------
CISCO ROUTERS:
-----
Routers require:
> CPU
> RAM
> ROM
> NVRAM
> OS
-----
Cisco routers have same general hardware components:
-=- console ports
-=- LAN interfaces
-=- expansion slots
-----
for different types of [interface modules]
ex: [EHWIC, serial, wireless, DSL, switch ports]
-----
storage slots for expanded capabilities
ex: compact flash memory, USB ports.

ANTIMAWARE PROTECTION:
-----
various network security devices required to protect
network perimeter from outside access.
-----
-> hardened router that is providing:
-=- VPN service
-=- NGFW
-=- IPS
-=- AAA server
-----
securing an internal LAN is nearly as important as
securing the outside network perimeter.
-----
Endpoints and the network infrastructure require
protection.

* -=- ~
3 types of antimalware programs:
-=- [signature-based]:
DB of known malwares
like fingerprints of known malwares
faster
-=- [heuristics-based]:
sus patterns or code structures
flag if new one behave similar to
existing signature
-=- [behaviour-based]:
watch how a program behave
if it does unusual
flag as malicious
catch new malwares
slows system, false positives
-----
[HIDS] = agent based
-----
antivirus runs on every protected machine.
[agentless antivirus] protection scans on
hosts from a centralized system.
-----
[host based firewalls]:
-=- Windows Defender Firewall
with advanced security features.
-=- iptables, TCP Wrappers on Linux.
-----
Protecting endpoints in a [borderless network]
-=- Cisco Secure Endpoint
-=- Cisco Secure Email
-=- Cisco Umbrella
-=- Network Admission and Control systems - [NAC]
These technologies work together with
host-based systems to secure enterprise.

---------------
FIREWALLS, HIPS:
-----
resist network attacks
only point between internal and external networks
enforce:
-=- access control policies,
-=- protect hosts from exposure,
-=- sanitize protocol flow,
-=- block malicious data from servers, clients.
-----
ineffective if misconfigured or out of date.
can slow networks and some data cannot
be passed over them.
-----
various types of firewalls:
-=- Packet filtering (stateless) firewalls:
usually part of a router firewall.
permit or deny traffic based on [L3, L4 info].
-=- Stateful firewalls:
versatile and most commonly used. 
Stateful filtering is a firewall architecture
that is classified at network layer.
analyses traffic at OSI [L4, L5].
-=- application gateway firewall (proxy firewall):
filters info at [L3, 4, 5, 7].
-=- Next-generation firewalls (NGFW):
goes beyond stateful firewalls.
-=- Transparent firewalls:
filter traffic between 2 bridged interfaces.
-=- Hybrid firewalls:
combine attributes of other firewall types.
-----
-=- stateless firewalls:
simple permit or deny rules
low impact on network performance
easy to implement
initial security at network layer.
[susceptible to IP spoofing]
ineffective against fragmented packets
can use complex [ACLs] that are
difficult to use and maintain.
-----
-=- stateful firewalls:
primary means of defence
filter unwanted, unnecessary, undesirable traffic
more effective than stateless firewalls.
[cannot prevent L7 attacks]
less effective against:
[stateless protocols]
difficult to track:
[dynamic port negotiation]
do not use authentication.
-----
-=- Host-based personal firewalls
standalone software programs
control traffic entering or leaving a computer
use a set of predefined policies, or profiles.
can have rules, can be modified or created to control
access based on addresses, protocols, ports.
[Windows Defender FW],
[iptables],
[nftables],
[TCP Wrappers].
-----
-=- Antimalware protection consists of:
antivirus, adware, phishing, spyware protection.
some antimalware software combines features of
different types.

SECURE WIRELESS ACCESS:
-----
Wireless networks susceptible to threats:
interception of data,
wireless intruders,
DoS attacks,
rogue APs.
-----
DoS attacks can result from
improperly configured devices,
malicious user interference,
accidental interference.
-----
Rogue APs can be used by attacker to capture
MAC addresses, capture data packets,
gain access to network resources, or launch a
man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.
-----
in MitM:
hacker is positioned between 2 legitimate entities
in order to read or modify data that passes between
the 2 parties.
-----
SSID cloaking:
SSID beacon frame is disabled.
manually permit or deny clients
wireless access based on their
physical MAC hardware address.
-----
Open system authentication should only be used in
situations where security is of no concern.
-----
Shared key authentication provides mechanisms
such as WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3
to authenticate and encrypt data between a wireless
client and AP.
WEP and WPA authentication are outdated and insecure.
WPA2 is recommended at a minimum with WPA3 preferred
when it becomes available.
-----
Personal authentication requires to
configure username, pre-shared password.
Enterprise authentication requires
RADIUS authentication server using 802.1x
with Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).
-----
Encryption protects data by making it unreadable
if intercepted.
WPA2 uses Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP)
or Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
-----
WPA3 when available is the
recommended 802.11 authentication method.
includes WPA3-Personal, WPA3-Enterprise,
Open Networks, and IoT onboarding.
WPA3 open or public Wi-Fi networks still do not
use any authentication.
they do use
Opportunistic Wireless Encryption (OWE)
to encrypt all wireless traffic.
For IoT onboarding,
WPA3 uses Device Provisioning Protocol (DPP)
to securely onboard IoT devices.
